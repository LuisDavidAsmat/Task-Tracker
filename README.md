# Task Tracker 
Task tracker is a project used to track and manage tasks. A simple command line interface (CLI) to track what you need to do, what you have done, and what you are currently working on. This project helped me to develop the following programming skills:
* Working with the filesystem.
* Handling user inputs.
* Building a simple CLI application.
